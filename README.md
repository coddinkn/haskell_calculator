# haskell_calculator
A multi function calculator written in Haskell, based upon the idea of the [reverse polish notation calculator] (http://learnyouahaskell.com/functionally-solving-problems#reverse-polish-notation-calculator) created in the [Learn you a Haskell for great good] (http://learnyouahaskell.com/) tutorial series. This calculator aims to provide more functions and use infix notation. The program takes a line of input of parenthesized math expressions (ie (5 + (5 * (5 - (5!))))), and supports addition, multiplication, subtraction, negation and factorial.
